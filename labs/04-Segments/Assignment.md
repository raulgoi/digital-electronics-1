### Seven-segment display decoder

1. Listing of VHDL stimulus process from testbench file (`tb_hex_7seg.vhd`) with asserts. Verify all input combinations. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

```vhdl
    p_stimulus : process
    begin
        report "Stimulus process started" severity note;
	
	s_hex <= "0000"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000001")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error;

		s_hex <= "0001"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0011111")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 1
        
        s_hex <= "0010"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0010010")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 2
        
        s_hex <= "0011"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000110")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 3
        
        s_hex <= "0100"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1001100")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 4
        
        s_hex <= "0101"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1001000")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 5
        
        s_hex <= "0110"; wait for 50 ns;
		assert (s_seg = "0100000")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 6
        
        s_hex <= "0111"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1110000")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 7
        
        s_hex <= "1000"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000000")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 8
        
        s_hex <= "1001"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000100")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- 9
        
        s_hex <= "1010"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0000001")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- A
        
        s_hex <= "1011"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1100000")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- b
        
        s_hex <= "1100"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0110001")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- C
        
        s_hex <= "1101"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "1000010")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- d
        
        s_hex <= "1110"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0110000")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- E
        
        s_hex <= "1111"; wait for 50 ns;
        assert (s_seg = "0111000")
        report "Input combination 0000 FAILED" severity error; -- F
      
      


        report "Stimulus process finished" severity note;
        wait;
    end process p_stimulus;
```

2. Screenshot with simulated time waveforms. Always display all inputs and outputs (display the inputs at the top of the image, the outputs below them) at the appropriate time scale!

### LED(7:4) indicators

1. Listing of LEDs(7:4) part of VHDL architecture from source file `top.vhd`. Try to write logic functions as simple as possible. Always use syntax highlighting, meaningful comments, and follow VHDL guidelines:

   ```vhdl
   --------------------------------------------------------------------
   -- Experiments on your own: LED(7:4) indicators

   -- Turn LED(4) on if input value is equal to 0, ie "0000"
   LED(4) <= `1` when (s_hex = "0000") else
       	     `0`; 
       

   -- Turn LED(5) on if input value is greater than "1001", ie 10, 11, 12, ...
   LED(5) <= `1` when (s_hex = "1010" and s_hex = "1011" and s_hex = "1100" and s_hex = "1101" and s_hex = "1110" and s_hex = "1111" ) else
       	     `0`;

   -- Turn LED(6) on if input value is odd, ie 1, 3, 5, ...
   LED(6) <=`1` when (s_hex = "0001" and s_hex = "0011" and s_hex = "0101" and s_hex = "0110" and s_hex = "1001" and s_hex = "1011" and s_hex = "1101" and s_hex ="1111") else
       	     `0`;

   -- Turn LED(7) on if input value is a power of two, ie 1, 2, 4, or 8
   LED(7) <= `1` when (s_hex = "0001" and s_hex = "0010" and s_hex = "0100" and s_hex = "1000") else
       	     `0`;
